## Hi there, IÂ´m Ewa ðŸ‘‹

I have a degree in accounting and taxation. I worked as an accountant in an e-shop for 4 years and even then I knew I wanted to do something more meaningful. My journey into the world of IT started with several online courses, where I learned the basics of individual technologies. After that, I started deepening my knowledge by creating my applications.

I would like to apply my knowledge to real projects and work with a team where I can continue to grow as a developer.
